See main readme for full details on implementation.

Kubernetes script can be found at style-clip/deployment/deploy-k8s-cluster.yml

All the other ansible scripts in the deployment folder have also been updated and deploy the containers on Google's "Deep Learning VM" - as mentioned in the other readme, this was the only way to actually run our container since none of us have GPUs.

See video for application demo (instead of screenshots)
